# From zero to Kubernetes!

This is just a simple howto devised to guide you to deploy a Kubernetes cluster :)

We'll use k3s to provide a simple cluster, there are two options:
- [manual mode](manual_mode.md)
- [automated mode](automated_mode.md)

For doubts or problemes don't doubt to raise an [issue](https://github.com/GeeksCAT/from-zero-to-k8s/issues/new)
